
Bike Sales Analysis

 Project Overview
	The Bike Sales Analysis project utilizes Microsoft Excel to analyze customer purchase 	behavior and visualize insights using an interactive dashboard. This project highlights 	patterns in bike purchases based on demographic, geographic, and commuterelated factors.

  Features
 	Interactive Dashboard: Filters and slicers to dynamically analyze data across different 	dimensions.
 	Customer Demographics: Analysis based on marital status, education level, gender, and age 	bracket.
 	Geographical Insights: Sales trends segmented by region (e.g., Europe, North America, 	Pacific).
 	Income Analysis: Correlation between customer income and purchase behavior.
 	Commute Analysis: Insights into how commute distance affects customer purchases.

 Key Metrics and Insights
 	Age Income Per Purchase: Average income distribution across genders for customers who 	purchased bikes versus those who did not.
 	Customer Age Bracket: Purchase trends based on age groups—adolescent, middle age, and old.
 	Customer Commute: Analysis of purchase patterns relative to commute distances (e.g., 0–1 	miles, 2–5 miles, etc.).

 Tools and Techniques
 	Microsoft Excel:
   		Data Cleaning: Organized and structured raw sales data for accurate analysis.
   		Formulas: Utilized Excel formulas for data transformations and calculations.
   		Pivot Tables: Created dynamic summaries for filtering and analyzing data.
   		Slicers: Enabled realtime filtering of data in the dashboard.
   		Charts: Visualized data trends using bar charts, line charts, and more.

 How to Use
	1. Open the Excel file containing the bike sales dataset.
	2. Navigate to the Bike Sales Dashboard sheet.
	3. Use the slicers (filters) for:
    		Marital status
    		Region
    		Education level
    		Age bracket
	4. Observe how the charts dynamically update based on the selected criteria.

 Outcomes
	The analysis provides actionable insights into:
 		Which customer demographics are more likely to purchase bikes.
 		The impact of income and commute distance on purchase decisions.
 		Regional preferences and trends.

 Future Enhancements
 	Expand the analysis to include seasonal trends.
 	Integrate data from other sources like marketing campaigns for a deeper understanding of 	customer behavior.
	Automate data cleaning and analysis using VBA macros.
